             <h2>Challenge</h2>
              <p>The goal of this lab was to work with my partner, create a lab 16
                index.html and create a site that used even fancier CSS. I had to make elements
								that used animations, transitions, columns, and experiment with more
								advanced backgrounds. For a bonus we worked together to make an extremely
								tacky web page.</p>
							<p>During our meeting we made the tacky lab together, afterwards we went our
								seperate ways to better our lab pages with our new knowledge.</p>
              <p>
                For this lab I;
                <li>added on to my lab 15 site,
                <li>used animations for the title, links and beatbox image,
                <li>fixed my image transitions and added another,
                <li>put my problems secion in a column,
								<li>created an extra tacky site using filters and everything in-between.
              </p>

            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p> The biggest challege was our tacky page because thats what we started with.
								It took us a long time to figure hout how to make animations. We decided to
								animate our borders so that it was as annoying as our gif background.</p>

            <p> I also had trouble with making a transition that would move across the screen.</p>

            <p> For my lab the animation with the beatbox took a bit to figure out. Other than that,
								working on my personal lab page was much easier than the tacky page.</p>

							<glow>Problem 1:</glow>
  							<div class="indent">
                  By using W3 Schools I learned that for an animation to be linked it needs
									a matching keyframe name with one element being the original and using the keyframe
									element as the change. I also learned about using pecentages as the "keyframes" and they
									function as if they are their own elements. We started small by animating the borders but it
									took a lot of time to figure out. I later used what I learned to animage my title, links, and an image.
  							</div>
						</p>

						<p>
							<glow>Problem 2: </glow>
  							<div class="indent">
									I resolved my transition issue by changing the image's position and the block that contained it.
									Turns out that if it inherits a centered feature, float left wont work at all same with positioning.
									I had to change the contianer and make a seperate centered block for the items I wanted centered.
									I also found that working with percentages made the transition easier.
  							</div>

           	<p>
							<glow>Problem 3:</glow>
                <div class="indent">
                  The hardest item in my lab was animating my beatbox image. The animation wasnt the hard part,
									it was the positioning that got tricky because the animation involved scaling in size.
									The animated scale broke the original positioning I had for the image. It took a
									while to fix but I ended up making it centered and had to fiddle with the positioning.
