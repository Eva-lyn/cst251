             <h2>Challenge</h2>
              <p>The goal of this lab is to work with my partner, create a lab7
                index.html and style it using CSS. We were told to edit or create
                our own id or class tags to make different divs. This challenge
                involed a lot of trial and error by using the inspector tool and
                testing locally.</p>

            <h2>Problems</h2>
              <p>My first problem was that I wanted to be able to have my "challenge"
                and "problems" content next to each other. A second problem was that I wanted
                to make certain content centered. A third issue I faced was with my margins for my
                wrapper div box. I worked on this issue with Leo and we seemed to be unable to solve it
                for a while.</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
  				<p>The solution to my first problem was found through stackoverflow.com.
            The solutions I found involved making an id that would wrap multiple divs in
            one area. I named my larger div "wrapper" and I made two sub ids named "content-right"
            and "content-left" so that I knew which div was going on which side. <br> I also found a way
            to center items by making a class named "center". By making this class I'm able
            to divide (div) any element and center it. I used this class for my title and image.
            <br>For the issue about our wrapper's margin, we solved this by playing with the size
            of the wrapper, size of the content divs, and the left margin of "content-right".
            I'm sure there is a better way to fix it but that is the solution we came up with.</p>
