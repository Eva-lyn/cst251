             <h2>Challenge</h2>
              <p>The goal of this lab was to work with my partner, create a lab 8
                index.html and style it using CSS selectors. We were told to use the
                same CSS that we created in lab 7 but add specific selectors. </p>
                <div class="bold">
                  <p>The new rules that we needed to add were;</p>
                  <li> To style every element of a particular class
                  <li> To style a particular type of element with a class name
                  <li> Make a rule that can style more than one element at a time
                  <li> Style an element within another element.
                </div>
              <p> This challenge involed a lot of trial and error by using the
                  inspector tool and testing locally.</p>

            <h2>Problems</h2>
              <p> My first task was to stylize my lists. After styling my list I made a
              class called .bold. I practiced the inheritance rules by putting my list in
              a div that has the class .bold.</p>
              <p><purple> Next I wanted to make certain words
              a different color by making a tag named purple.</purple></p>
              <p>I also wanted to make my image rounded and change sizes when it is
              hovered over by the mouse. In order for my image to be rounded and
              change sizes at the same time I had to make very specific rules in
              my code to make it all work, this involved refrencing children
              and using multiple divs.

          <h2>Results</h2>
        </div>

  				<bold>Problem 1:</bold>
							<div class="indent">
								I created a class called .bold so that whatever text
								is inside the div with the class .bold would have a font weight of 600.
							</div>
							<br>
					<bold>Problem 2: </bold>
							<div class="indent">
								For the purple text, I made a tag named purple.
								I'm sure this isnt a real tag but I learned in
								class that HTML 5 is very flexible with made up tags and its rules.
							</div>
							<br>
					<bold>Problem 3: </bold>
						 	<div class="indent">
								I rounded my image and created an 8px purple border to frame the image.
								The hardest part of this task was making a rule that would increase the size
								of the image when hovered over. Originally I set up my css rule as;
								<div class="indent">
									<purple>div.special:hover, img.round {}</purple>
								</div>
						 		This took away the effects of img.round. After a ton of trial and error I came to the conclusion of;
								<div class="indent">
									<purple>div.special:hover>img.round {}</purple>
								</div>

						 		This kept my image effect and allowed it to change sizes.
							</div>
							<br>
					<bold>Problem 4: </bold>
						<div class="indent">
							My last task was to visually clean up my site and this included;
							<div class="indent">
								<li> Fixing my div problem from lab 7
								<li> Fixing issues with my .center class
								<li> Creating a div class for my image so that it doesnt interfere with the text
								<li> Creating icons that connected my current page to my landing site and to the next lab
								<li> Cleaning up my CSS.
							</div>
