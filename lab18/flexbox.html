					<h2>Challenges</h2>
						<p>For this lab I was told to work with a partner, create a lab 18 page
							using flexbox layout, and add a media query to make it more responsive.
							I used the same flexbox layout from lab 17 and I am glad I did.
							By changing some things in css with what I learned in class I was able
							to fix some issues that I had from last lab. However using the media query
							was a bit difficult at first simply because I didn't understand what I was doing.
						</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
						<p><li>The main issue I had was with finding out how to use the media query.
								From the lecture I understood that the < meta > went inside my HTML but
								I was unsure of how to set it up in CSS.
							<li>I also didnt realize that the media query element in css used two sets
								of curly brackets. Because of this it caused for a lot of my code to be broken.
								This was actually very frustrating because for a couple hours I couldn't
								figure out what was broken and why.
							<li>The final problem I had was with adjusting my layout to make it better.
								This took a while but I really wanted to nail this skill down so that I
								could use it later.

					<h2>Results</h2>
						<p>I learned that you only want to include the parent divs in the media
							query element in css. Just like how flexbox works, if the parent is flex
							so will be the children. So I fixed this problem by only including
							#top, main , #bottom, section, and aside.</p>
							<p>Just like the animation element, media query has two sets of (or more)
							curly brackets. Because I didn't know this, I was missing a bracket in my
							query element and this forced the browser to add a bracket at the end of my css.
							This made every css element below the media query broken. I felt really silly
							spending hours trying to figure this out only to find out I had a missing bracket.</p>
							<p>While fixing up my layout I needed to get rid of all the floats, margins,
							padding, and thick borders. From there I was able to fix my layout. I also had
						 	to dabble in what flexbox had to offer to make things work.</p>
							<p> I also experimented with moving #bottom to the inside of Main to see how it looked.
							I liked it at first but didn't keep it because once the Aside block wrapped under Main
							It didin't look like it belonged there anymore.
