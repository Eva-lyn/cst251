             <h2>Challenge</h2>
              <p>The goal of this lab was to work with my partner, create a lab 14
                index.html and create another fake website using typography and the knowledge
                I have. This lab included using multiple fonts, ids, divs, and block
                styling. I chose to mimic the screenshot from the BEACH screenshot.
								I didn't have a partner for this lab.</p>

              <p>
                For this lab I;
                <li>duplicated my lab 13 folder and its corresponding files,
                <li>edited the html and css in my fake files,
                <li>I found fonts similar to the screenshot from google fonts,
                <li>I used blocks to mimic the typography,
								<li>I created a shirtless goat portrait and recreated the graphics,
                <li>created a z frame for my fake site to appear in my lab 14.
              </p>
        </div>

        <div id="content-right">
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p> Finding the fonts that looked similar to the screenshot was much easier this time.
								It was just a matter of finding a sans-serif font that had the same
								curves and lines as the original text.</p>

            <p> The two hardest parts of displaying the typography was creating the
								underline under the links and trying to make my headline responsive.</p>

            <p> After placing my headline I had to position my shirtless goat but also crop
								the image within css.</p>

						<p> For my links I used my new knowlegde from the lecture about fancy css to create
								the underlines. This was important because my links contained graphics.</p>

    				<bold>Problem 1:</bold>
  							<div class="indent">
                  The fonts that I decided to use include;
                  <span class="purple">Assistant weight 800, Montserrat weight 700
									and Raleway weight 400, 600, and 800.</span>

        <div id="floated2">
            <bold>Problem 3:</bold>
                <div class="indent">
                  For my naked goat portrait I used the knowledge I gained from the
									extra credit assignement in lab 12. I made the image larger than the
									block that it was in so that Mikey's legs would be cropped out to fit
									to the screen. I then used positioning to place the block so that it
									looked good with the text.
                </div>
        </div>

				<div id="center-horz">
  					<bold>Problem 2: </bold>
  							<div class="indent">
									The headline was tricky becasue I couldn't find a responsive way to
									display my headline text. When the screen is shrunken the text isn't
									shrunken or moved with the page. I tried using spans and margins but
									that didn't work. I wish I could ave found a way to make the space
									between the letters shrink with the page.
  							</div>
        </div>
				<bold>Problem 4:</bold>
						<div class="indent">
							For the line under my links I found that you can't edit the text decoration. So
							I used what I learned about shadow-box to create an underline that would fit to
							the content it surrounded. The shadow-box also allowed for the underline to be
							adjusted. This was important because my links contained arrow graphics and text
							decoration only underlines the text.
