			My name is Eva-lyn Mendoza and I am very excited to be learning about
			web coding and other web tools. I enjoy problem solving and finding ways
			I could make my personal skillset better. I am not too sure if I would use
			web development in my career but I would like to use it for my hobbies.
			I've been wanting to make a website for my postcard collection for a while
			now. Now, I will have a means of doing so!
