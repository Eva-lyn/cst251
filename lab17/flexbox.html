					<h2>Challenges</h2>
						<p>For the flexbox page we were told to use flexbox elements in css so that
						our page functioned with flexboxes. I do like the way the flexbox element looks.
						I didn't have to worry about aligning the main block with the aside block
						because flexbox took care of that for me. It also allowed me not to worry about filling space.
						I'm excited to apply flexbox to my personal lab layout because it would resolve my
						block size and aligning issue.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
						<p><li>The main issue I had was with getting my flexboxes to wrap the way I wanted them to.
							<li>There was also an issue with the size of my blocks. Even though they were set to 100%
								of the page, they exceeded the width of my screen size once I added borders and padding.
								I've never had this problem before so I really don't know what it is.
							<li> I struggled with the effect my blocks take when they wrap when shrunken. I wanted them to
								expand to 100% once they wrapped under eachother but I wasn't able to figure out how to do that.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
						<p>I decided to dress up this page with css because I was excited to see how it would look
							with color and more styling. I tried my best to keep it simple but I struggle with that.
							The point of this lab was to focus on layout but I couldnt help myself.</p>
							<p>I really do like
							how I was able to get this block to expand to 100% below the upper two blocks and then
							shrink to the same size as the upper blocks.</p>
							<p>I really do wish I could have figured out how to get my blocks to expand once they wrapped under eachother.
							Below is the wrapping problem I'm talking about specifically.</p>
