			<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>For this lab I was told to work with a partner, make an index.html and copy
				   	my index into different layot pages. Each page had to use a different layout method.
					The layout methods used for this lab are float, flexbox, and grid. In the directions
					it was mentioned that this page should focus more on content so I will regretably keep
					my page's css simple. We were also told to make a sketch of what we wanted our lab
					layout to look like. This is our sketch;</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p><li>The first major problem of this lab was that my partner's css didnt work when we first met.
				This prevented us from moving forward with our lab because she wasnt able to troubleshoot
				anything she was doing.
						<li>Our second major problem was conflicts with our schedule. We were only able to meet
				once but thats ok.
						<li>I had trouble understanding how flexbox worked in terms of wrapping and orietation. There
				was also an issue with the size of my blocks. Even though they were set to 100% of the page, they
				exceeded the width of my screen size once I added borders and padding. I've never had this problem
				before so I really dont know what it is.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>
				<li>My partner was able to get her css to work eventually which was great.
				<li>As for working with my partner, we decided to finish up on our own for the duration of the
				lab because meeting up became too difficult.
				<li>I decided to keep my index page as sort of a wire frame so that it most closely looks like
				our original sketch. I had a hard time not putting in hours of time to fix up my css.
				I also decided to keep my grid and float layouts as wireframes. I decided to dress up my flexbox
				page to make up for the empty space once it is scrunched up.</p>
