					<h2>Challenge</h2>
						<p>For this lab I was told to work by myself, create a lab 20 page
							and insert my group project website sketches. These were meant to be
							quick wireframe sketches but I put in a little extra effort cause, I'm me.
							There was a required total of 15 sketches so I made three "options"
							or ideas of what the site could look like. I actually enjoyed this process
							and I think I came up with some good ideas.
						</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
						<p><li>The first set of sketech I wade was with the intention of using bootstrap
								to do all of the work. I found this sketch to be too coorporate and generic.
							<li>The second sketch I made was inspired by the squarespace website I wrote
								about at the beginning of the semester. I loved how the homepage opened up
								seamlessly into the next pages. I thought having a more graphic hompage was fun.
							<li>My third skets was going off of the ideas of the secong but insead of being
								organized and coorporate I wanted a more graphic and fun look. The homepage
								would look like a bedroom with icons that move when hovered. The sub pages are
								more graphic aswell.
