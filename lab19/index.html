				<h2> Problems <h2>
				<p class="small">For this lab I had to work with a partner, create an index.html and then
				use bootstrap formatting. We had to separate ou lab into three blocks and
				also add a navbar using only bootstrap elements. For this lab I had two partners
				so that was fun.</p>

				<h2> Challenges <h2>
				<p class="small">Starting this lab was really hard because everything seemed to be in a
					different language. We finally got it done though, after spending a lot
					of time on w3schools. I also didnt understand what needed to be in class
					content because we couldnt find any such block or element that used content
				 	as a class. We just followed what w3schools mentioned.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-sm-12">
				<h2> Solutions <h2>
				<p class="small">My page looks extremely basic and oldschool, I have definately seen this
					nav bar one too many times. Very tumblr-esque. Im glad that I am learning
				 	bootstrap now because for my other class my partner wants to use it for our
					site. I am hoping that I will get more familiar with it and be able to make
					it look less generic.</p>
