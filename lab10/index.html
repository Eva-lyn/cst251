             <h2>Challenge</h2>
              <p>The goal of this lab was to work with my partner, create a lab 10
                index.html and further style my text. In class I was able to get
                my background image up and running with the help of my teacher.
                I then fixed some styling issues in my title.</p>

              <p>
                For this lab Leo and I;
                <li> found fonts that I liked in google fonts,
                <li> ,
                <li> .
              </p>

            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>  The first major problem that leo and I faced involved the
                  placement of our content blocks. </p>
            <p>  Next I wanted to make a repeating background to go behind
                  my content.</p>
            <p>  I also wanted to make a semi-transparent block to go behind
                  my icon links. The main issue I had with this task was maintaining
                  the color I wanted. I was also thinking of making all of my blocks
                  colored and semi-transparent but I found that it visually interfered
                  with my text.</p>
            <p>  In all, this lab didnt require much especially since we have both been
                  experimenting with blocks in our website.</p>

        </div>

  				<bold>Problem 1:</bold>
							<div class="indent">
								I found the solution to our placement issue by remembering a specific thing
                that Wes said in class. He said that if we don't define a width our block
                will take up the width of the screen. Since we previously defined the width,
                it caused a display problem on Leo's end because his screen is much larger
                than mine. By removing the defined width we fixed our problem.

					<bold>Problem 2: </bold>
							<div class="indent">
								For my repeated background I made an image that could be repeated
                and appear seamless. <purple>However no matter what I tried my image would not
                appear.</purple> I watched videos, read forums, and reviewed w3 schools and
                there seems to be no problem in my css. I'm hoping I can get this
                fixed in class because I was really excited about using a detailed background.

					<bold>Problem 3: </bold>
						 	<div class="indent">
								I had already created a div for my icons in lab 8 but now I wanted
                to define it with an opaque color and shape. After adding some padding
                I rounded the corners to 20px and changed the color to #ECE0FF. The main
                issue with using the color hex number was that I wasnt able to make it
                opaque without making the content opaque. I solved this issue by converting
                my hex color to rgb so that I could change the transparency of the color I wanted.
							</div>
							<br>
					<bold>Problem 4: </bold>
						<div class="indent">
							Finally I changed the padding in my #content and #wrapper divs to appear more roomy
              on the screen. I am happy with my borders and background colors, I just really wish
              I could have gotten my background image to work.
