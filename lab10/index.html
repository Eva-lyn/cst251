             <h2>Challenge</h2>
              <p>The goal of this lab was to work with my partner, create a lab 10
                index.html and further style my text. This lab included using various fonts
                for the body and headings. We were also challenged to style the text
                in our landing page. Before Leo and I met, we both searched for google
                fonts that we liked.</p>

              <p>
                During our meeting we;
                <li> found and linked fonts from google fonts into our css,
                <li> worked on changing letter spacing, word spacing, and line height,
                <li> got Leo's background image up and running,
                <li> and we styled the text in our landing page.
              </p>
        </div>
        <div id="content-right">
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>  In class I was able to get my background image up and running
                with the help of my teacher. I then fixed some styling issues in my title. </p>

            <p>  Next I needed to find fonts that I liked from google fonts. This was tricky
                because out of the fonts that were available none really matched the
                look that I was going for. So I just had to settle and pick some. </p>

            <p> After linking our google fonts we worked on changing the spacing of our fonts.</p>

            <p> The hardest part of our lab was getting Leo's background image to work.
                Connection problems greatly interfered with our meeting but we were able to find
                the problem and fix it.</p>

            <p> After our meeting we then worked on fine tuning our style which included
                styling the text in our landing page. </p>

          <h2>Results</h2>
        </div>

  				<bold>Problem 1:</bold>
							<div class="indent">
                My background image is running successfully with no further problems.
                I am very happy with the way it came out.
							</div>
							<br>
					<bold>Problem 2: </bold>
							<div class="indent">
                The fonts I used from google fonts include;
                <li> <purple>Open Sans Condensed</purple>, I used this for my body,
                <li> <purple>Open Sans Condensed Bold</purple>, I used this for all of my bold text in my body,
                <li> <purple>Special Elite</purple>, I used this for my h2, h3 headings.</li>
                I didn't change the font of my title because I couldn't find a google font
                that was cursive and bold.
							</div>
							<br>
					<bold>Problem 3: </bold>
						 	<div class="indent">
                Editing the letter spacing, word spacing, and line height was relatively
                easy. We just changed these values until they appeared to look appealing.
							</div>
							<br>
					<bold>Problem 4: </bold>
						<div class="indent">
                For Leo's background image we found out that he linked both his lab.css
                and site.css which was causing conflicts. He also had a background color
                for his body which covered most of his background image. Once we took care
                of those two things we were able to successfully get his image working.

            <br>
        <bold>Problem 5: </bold>
            <div class="indent">
              For my landing page I imported the text styles from my Lab 10 css to my Site.css.
              After importing my css I made some color changes to match the color
              scheme of my homepage. I am very happy with how it all looks.
