             <h2>Challenge</h2>
              <p>The goal of this lab was to work with my partner, create a lab 13
                index.html and create a fake website using typography and they knowledge
                I have. This lab included using multiple fonts, ids, divs, and block
                styling. I chose to mimic the screenshot from Mail Chimp's 2016 holiday
                tips page. I didn't have a partner for this lab.</p>

              <p>
                For this lab I;
                <li>created a lab 13 folder and its corresponding files,
                <li>created a fake.html and a fake.css for my mimic site,
                <li>I found fonts similar to the screenshot from google fonts,
                <li>I used spans and blocks to mimic the typography,
                <li>created a z frame for my fake site to appear in my lab 13.
              </p>
        </div>

        <div id="content-right">
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p> Finding the fonts that looked similar to the screenshot I used was the
                most difficult part of the lab. Before settling on google fonts I spent
                hours trying to find look alikes on dafont.com and tried my best to use the
                font generators generated in class.</p>

            <p> The tricky part of displaying the typography was creating individual
                classes for my words and letters that used different fonts.</p>

            <p> After inserting my letters and words I then had to position them so that
                they mimic the type of my screenshot. I also had to find and make some
                graphics that matched the original site. <span class="purple">Below
                is a screenshot of the original site.</span></p>
        </div>

    <div id="center-both">
      <img src="img/original.png" alt="original website" width="600px">

    				<bold>Problem 1:</bold>
  							<div class="indent">
                  I realized I needed to settle for google fonts because I was wasting
                  a lot of time by trying to find fonts that looked the same. I decided to use
                  <span class="purple">Stardos Stencil, Crimson Text italic and regular,
                    Kanit weight 600 and 900, Kameron weight 700, and Heebo weight 900.</span>
  							</div>
        </div>

        <div id="floated2">
            <bold>Problem 3:</bold>
                <div class="indent">
                  Positioning got tricky for a while because it leaves a phantom space where
                  the text used to be so the div block is much larger than it needs to.
                  I don't quite know how to fix that. In the end I was able to get it all spaced
                  out correctly.I also created the yellow arrow and green scroll triangle, the logo
                  was from google images.

  					<bold>Problem 2: </bold>
  							<div class="indent">
                  I had to create different classes for each letter and word that used a different font.
                  In all I made 9 classes for fonts. For the "tips" portion i used mix-blend-mode multiply
                  to get the same blending effect. I also used a color picker to find the colors
                  that the original used. I didnt have to use any z values, I just made sure that
                  things were in order in my html.
