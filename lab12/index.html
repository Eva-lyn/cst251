             <h2>Challenge</h2>
              <p>The goal of this lab was to work with my partner, create a lab 12
                index.html and use advanced block-level styling to further style
                our site. This lab included using multiple ids to float, horzontally
                center, and vertically center blocks.
                We were also challenged to style an image to be larger than its div block
                and both horzontally and vertically center it.</p>

              <p>
                During our meeting we;
                <li> created our lab 12 files and folders,
                <li> worked on creating the divs instructed in the lab.

            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p> We had to cut our meeting short because I was having a migraine attack
              so working with that hurdle was hard.</p>

            <p> The instructions in the lab were detailed enough where we didn't struggle too
                much, or at least on my end I didnt. Leo didnt communicate too much for
                this lab.</p>

            <p> The only hard item was horzonally and vertically centering an image.</p>
            <div id="extra">
              <img src="img/herb.jpeg" width=200px>

            <div id="extra-txt">
              This is my image for the extra point! It is a sticker that I saw from
              a sticker shop called B-Side Label in Shibuya, Japan. Enjoy. "No herb
              will cure stupid."

  							<div class="indent">
                  I had to cut our meeting short due to a migraine attack. Once I felt
                  better I tried making contact with Leo again but he was very unresponsive.
                  I ended up having to do most of the lab on my own again which I don't enjoy
                  doing. Especially since I wasn't feeling well at all.

        <div id="floated2">
            <bold>Problem 3:</bold>
                <div class="indent">
                  For the vertically and horzontally centered image I used the the css listed in
                  Wes' lecture. I didnt make the div 30% wide because it didt center the image to my
                  content div so I made the div's width fill the container in terms of width.

  					<bold>Problem 2: </bold>
  							<div class="indent">
                  During our meeting we were able to get div id="floated, div id="center-horz",
                  and div id="center-img" to work. Or at least I did, I gave Leo my solution
                  but he never followed up if it worked for him or not.
