		<h1>More HTML</h1>
			<p>The big idea of this lab was to create a webpage with images that links
				to other pages.</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>I was having difficulties creating a link with my images. Leo helped me out
			 		by navagating for me. After testing out my code locally, my images wouldnt
			 		display and my link was being treated like a separate paragraph. We found
					out that the issue was in two areas; first, I forgo to put img/ in my image
					link, and second, I put a ">" after my anchor "< a" which caused my
					link not to work.Once I fixed those errors everything worked perfectly!</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
