		<h1>Lab:6 More Complicated HTML</h1>
				<p>The lab was to work with a partner, create an html file and then
					 style it with a CSS file.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>I was able to figure out how to link my labs to a css file as soon as
				Lab:2 so for this assignment I was ahead. Which isn't a problem, it gave me
				time to find ways to edit my css to make things look better. By using codepen.io
				I was able to figure out how to edit the padding and margins for my input features.
				I also personalized the input box my making it all themed, it was a fun thing to edit.
				Leo and I helped eachother through slack, we helped eachother understand some
				coding concepts.</p>
