					<h2>Challenge</h2>
						<p>For this lab I was told to take my sketch ideas from my last lab assignment,
							get feedback from my team, and further develop a few of these ideas.
							My team really liked the bedroom idea in sketch 3 so I developed that
							idea into a kind of prototype. I made two layouts using different feedback.
						</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> This is the feedback I recieved for my first 3 page sketches </p>
						<li> Page 1: they liked the yoyo graphic but the rest was a bit boring
							because they were just wireframes.
						<li> Page 2: They liked the hanging yoyo concept but we were concerned
							if we could pull it off. They also suggested that I use different textbox shapes.
							Stephanie liked the hanging yoyo link page the most, just concerned about practicallity.
						<li> Page 3: They told me less is more in terms of complexity. This was the
							best pick. They wanted to see a unified theme that was possibly multimedia
							(real photos) they also said it was too wordy (maybe make the text wireframes smaller)
							they also said to use color to see how it would look for both the homepage and
							scrolling sub pages. Leo and Stephanie liked the icon home screen and how the scrolling pages look.
