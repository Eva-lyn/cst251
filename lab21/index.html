					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> This is the feedback I recieved for my first 3 page sketches </p>
						<li> Page 1: they liked the yoyo graphic but the rest was a bit boring
							because they were just wireframes.
						<li> Page 2: They like hanging yoyo concept but we were concerned with
							if we could pull it off. The reccomended me to use different textbox shapes.
							Stephanie liked the hanging yoyo link page the most, just concerned about practicallity.
						<li> Page 3: They told me less is more in terms of complexity. This was the
							best pick. They wanted to see a unified theme tht was possibly multimedia
							(real photos) they also said it was too wordy (maybe make the text wireframes smaller)
							they also said to use color to see how it would look for both the homepage and
							scrolling sub pages. Leo and Stephanie like the icon home screen and how the scrolling pages look.
