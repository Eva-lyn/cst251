             <h2>Challenge</h2>
              <p>The goal of this lab was to work with my partner, create a lab 11
                index.html and work on advanced block level styling. This lab included using
                the position and display vlue to place our blocks. We challenged to
                style a nav that would stick and style an aside div that would be on the
                right of our page.</p>

              <p>
                During our meeting we;
                <li> made our lab 11 files,
                <li> worked on making our nav and aside divs in html,
                <li> styled our new divs,
                <li> troubleshooted our new elements.
              </p>

            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>  First we had to create our lab 11 files, this was the easiest part
                of our assignment.</p>

            <p>  Next we made our aside div and wrote our fun-fact paragraph. We also
                put our links into a nav div.</p>

            <p> Styling our new blocks was the hardest part. we still dont understand it.
                </p>

            <p> Troubleshooting was even more difficult and frustrating because our
                aside block was hard to manipulate</p>

      <h3> Fun Facts </h3>
      <p>I live in a small agruculture town in Southern California. I live on 3 acres
        and I am currently raising goats and chickens. Our goats are non-livestock so they
        are effectively pets. My goat's name is Mikey and he loves to lay on people and cuddle.
        I have a post card collection with cards dating back to 1905. I also like to collect
        tea, taxidermy butterflies, and Japanese culture related items and clothing.
        I hand make cards in my spare time and I enjoy writing snail-mail. </p>
      <p>When I was 9 I had an official story pitch interview with Disney Animation Studios.
        I strongly believe that they stole parts of my pitch but what can I do. That
        experience taught me the value of creative rights, properly copyrighting my ideas,
        and never to trust coorporations.</p>
      <p>While I was at a church youth camp-out I found a human skull at Veil Lake.
        I was 14 at the time, investigators told us that it was the remains of a native american.
        I'm not sure if they were telling the truth. I used to dress 1950's vintage style
        while I was in my first two years of college.</p>

  				<bold>Problem 1:</bold>
							<div class="indent">
                Creating our files and new divs was easy enough. The real hardship
                came when we began to style in css.
							</div>
							<br>
					<bold>Problem 2: </bold>
							<div class="indent">
                Styling nav was the easiest to style since we just used position: sticky
                and placed how far or low the bar would sit. The aside bar was the hardest to work wiith.
                We couldnt decide on a position to use. I used relative and leo used absolute.
                We then worked on the placement values when we were in inspector.

							<br>
					<bold>Problem 3: </bold>
						 	<div class="indent">
                Troubleshooting was extremely frustrating. We couldnt get our block
                to go to the right for the longest and it would overlap our main content block
                dispite both being inline-blocks. In the ende we came up with a semi conclusion
                but I'm not sure it works on Leo's end so its not a true fix. We were really stumped
                in this lab.
