			<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>Before working with my partner Leo I wanted to mess around with the css
					for my labs. I wanted to make my labs a seperate color frommy home page.
					This wasnt required in the assignment but it helped me realize the importance
					of file structures and how files are found and linked in HTML. It took me a
					while to find out how to link my second css file to my labs. After looking
					at the lecture again i realized that since I put my second css file in the
					parent css file i could link the file to my labs by using "..". Linking my
					labs to ../css/site2.css became successful.</p>
